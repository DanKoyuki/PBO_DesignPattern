Those class only has constructor and well clone method (for Prototype) because i don't know what to make, there no specific requirement in this assignment.
Since there no specific requirement, i can't decide what to make for Singelton. Therefore i'm using one class in my OOP (Practice Class) for that, its was
a JFrame class that hold player position in map(?). the source code can be found at https://gitlab.com/arashikoyuki8/pbo/-/blob/main/src/com/Main/MainFrame.java or in word file.
